The Machathon4.0 Judge repository provides all the required tools and utilities for the [Machathon4.0 Competition - self driving cars edition](https://www.facebook.com/events/1344518816336469). It features convenient wrapper functions for controlling the movement of the car and capturing images from the camera within the CoppeliaSim simulator. It also includes the judge code that evaluates the competitor's solution and updates the leader-board. 

For more information about the competition regulations, please refer to the Official Competition [Rules Book](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f5tKFI4mWJoQy0Vv3YQ2X8SHJh2JxGTu?usp=sharing).
## Installation

1. Clone the repositry <br>
```git clone https://github.com/NouranHany/Machathon4.0-Judge.git```

2. Navigate to the repository directory <br> ```cd Machathon4.0-judge```

3. Install all dependencies needed <br>
```pip install -r .\requirements.txt```

## How to Use the Judge?

1. Create an instance of the Judge class and provide your team information, including the team name, team code, and the path to a zip containing your code. <br>
```python
judge = Judge(team_name="TeamX", team_code=12345, code_file_paths=['your_solution.zip'])
```

2. Pass the function where you have written your main solution to the judge. For example, if your solution is in a function named run_car, use the following code: <br>
```python
judge.set_run_hook(run_car)
```

3. Call the judge to run your code. The judge will call your code twice and calculate the lap time for each run. If you choose to publish the lap time to the leaderboard, set the `send_score` parameter to `True`. <br>
```python
judge.run(send_score=True)
```
The provided `test.py` file demonstrates how to use the Judge class. Note: don't submit your solution using this script as it uses the keyboard to manually control the car which is against the rules.

## Preparation for running the code
Before running your code, it's important to make sure you have opened the `filteration_scene.ttt` in CoppeliaSim. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open CoppeliaSim.
2. Load the `filteration_scene.ttt` file by going to File > Open Scene > Browse, then navigating to the location where the scene file is stored.
